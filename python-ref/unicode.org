* Introduction

By default, all strings in Python (since version 3) are Unicode,
UTF-8. Byte arrays (type "bytes") are not - they're just old-style
bytes.

* Converting to Unicode

** From bytes

For example, you've read my_bytes from the network:

my_bytes.decode()   # return string (utf-8) representation

* Converting from Unicode

** To bytes

For example, because you want to send a string over the network:

my_string.encode()  # returns byte representation
