* Notes from Pluralsight Introduction to JavaScript & jQuery

* Terminology

| Term | Description                                                      |
|------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DOM  | Document object model. Web pages are stored in memory with this. |
|      |                                                                  |

* Intro

** Unobtrusive

- Stuff is kept separate.

| Behavior  | Content    | Presentation |
|-----------+------------+--------------|
| jquery.js | index.html | style.css    |
| custom.js |            |              |

** Reduces browser inconsistencies

- With jQuery, you don't have to worry about which browser you're using.

** Find something / do something

*** Find something

- The dollar sign is not magical.

- In jQuery, most things start with $.

- Examples: 

  - $('div') // Find every div on the page

*** Do something

- For example, let elements "listen" for something to happen:

  - The document is ready.

  - User does something.

  - Another "listener" acts.

  - Certain amount of time elapses.

- Do something:

  - Manipulate elements

  - Animate elements

  - Communicate with the server

** Dev Tools

*** Modernizr

- www.modernizr.com will feature test your browser (I think?).

*** Can I use

- caniuse.com tells you which features are supported by which
  browsers.

*** Code sharing

**** jsfiddle

- jsfiddle.net "Hey, I created a fiddle, can you look at it?". Seems
  similar to pasteebin.

- jsbin.com is similar to jsfiddle.

*** Chrome developer tools

- code.google.com/chrome/devtools/
